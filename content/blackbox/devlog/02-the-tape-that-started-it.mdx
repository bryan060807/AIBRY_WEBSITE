## DEVLOG 02 – **The Tape That Started It**

I didn’t wake up thinking, “I’m going to build an AI that turns trauma into cassette artifacts.”

I just got sick of what already exists.

Every “AI journal” app I’ve seen behaves like a fake therapist with a script. It responds with the same neutral, soft, emotionally padded nonsense. That might work for some people. It doesn’t work for me.

Emotions aren’t clean. They don’t come out in bullet points or neat little affirmations. They hit sideways, glitch, distort, repeat, loop.

The closest analog I’ve ever felt to a real emotional record is:
a damaged tape.

- Warped playback  
- Hiss and static  
- Dropouts where something heavy used to be  
- Overloaded sections where the signal’s too strong  

So the core question that started all this:

> What if an AI could take what you’re feeling  
> and turn it into something that looks and sounds like a tape pulled from a haunted Walkman?

Not a “daily gratitude prompt.”  
Not a calendar tracker.  
Not a mood-chart graph.

A **physical-feeling artifact**:
- a fictional cassette label,
- a scrawled notebook entry,
- a spoken word track that sounds like the inside of your skull at 3am.

That’s the origin.

This project started as disrespect toward boring tools  
and a deep respect for the mess.

## DEVLOG 03 – **Teaching a Machine About Human Rage**

Today was about rage.

I wired up the first version of the “emotion modes” for the Emotional Black Box:
- `raw`
- `rage`
- `healing`
- `static`
- `lyric`

Then I gave the model an assignment:

> Take this messy paragraph about burnout and frustration  
> and rewrite it as someone trying to crawl out of their own skin.

The response hit harder than I expected.

It didn’t just make it louder.  
It made it **truer**.

Lines came back that felt like:
- the tightness in your chest when you can’t say what you mean,  
- the moment your brain goes white-hot and quiet at the same time,  
- the “I’m not okay but I’m still standing here” energy.

That’s when it clicked:

I’m not asking this AI to be wise, polite, or “wellness-friendly.”  
I’m asking it to **translate emotional signals into a language I actually recognize.**

Rage-mode isn’t about screaming.  
It’s about being brutally specific:
the way your thoughts loop,
the words you don’t say out loud,
the ugly stuff that doesn’t fit in a caption.

This devlog entry is a reminder to myself:

- If this tool ever starts sounding like a therapist, I broke it.  
- If it starts sounding like a confession with teeth, I’m on the right track.

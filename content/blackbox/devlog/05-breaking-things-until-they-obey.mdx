## DEVLOG 05 – **Breaking Things Until They Obey**

The high from yesterday didn’t last long.

Today was pure chaos:
- API route failures  
- Supabase complaints  
- TypeScript whining about types it absolutely knows exist  
- An AI response that tried to name a tape `"undefined"`  

Zero glamour. Just error messages and stubbornness.

At one point, the whole system broke because of:
- a missing field in the insert payload  
- and a typo in a column name  

Six hours of “what the hell is going on” for one tiny mistake.
Welcome to software development.

It’s funny how similar this feels to emotional work:

- You think you’ve fixed the main issue  
- Then something small and stupid breaks everything sideways  
- And eventually you realize you forgot to wire up something basic

But underneath the frustration, something important is happening:

The Emotional Black Box is turning from an idea into infrastructure.

- There’s a real database.  
- There are real routes.  
- There’s a devlog documenting all of this.  
- There’s a home for it at `/blackbox` in the site.

Glitches aren’t a sign that it’s failing.  
They’re proof that it’s alive enough to break.

Tonight, the system runs.  
Tomorrow, I make it prettier.  
Eventually, this thing is going to feel less like an app  
and more like a room people step into when they’re ready to face themselves.
